### Known Issues

Users unfortunately can't win diagonally, yet. The game's complexity wasn't fully clear to me until I reached the win logic part of coding. I had to re-plan and only include horizontal and vertical wins to the new MVP.  

The user experience of the game could also be improved: instructions on a separate screen with a button to start the game, button to reset the game when it finishes, etc.


###Â Challenges and Wins

We started this project two and a half weeks into our coding bootcamp, after only a little over a week of learning JavaScript. To get to a functioning game after that is a win enough for me. There were a lot of challenging moments, but that's what the learning process is like ðŸ¤“.


### Future Work

If I had more time I would:

- Add event listeners on the entire column, as opposed to the 'invisible' top row, to better guide the user.
- Diagonal wins.
- Reset game button.
- Improve styling.
- Add sounds effects with HTML5 audio.
- Give users the option to choose from a few different token colours.
- Subtle animation on the winning tokens at the end of the game.
